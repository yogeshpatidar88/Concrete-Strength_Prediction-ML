#Concrete Strength Prediction and Comparison of Different Linear Models#
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its ingredients using linear regression models. It also compares the performance of different linear models to identify which is most effective for this dataset.

Concrete strength is influenced by various factors such as cement, water, aggregates, and admixtures. Accurate prediction can help in optimizing material composition and ensuring safety and durability.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Feature	Description
Cement (kg/m³)	Amount of cement
Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m³)	Amount of slag
Fly Ash (kg/m³)	Amount of fly ash
Water (kg/m³)	Amount of water
Superplasticizer (kg/m³)	Amount of superplasticizer
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³)	Amount of coarse aggregate
Fine Aggregate (kg/m³)	Amount of fine aggregate
Age (days)	Curing time in days
Concrete Strength (MPa)	Target variable

The dataset can be obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository
